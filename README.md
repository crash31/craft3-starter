# Craft 3 Starter Kit
Getting started with a fresh new project.

- Clone repo `git clone https://github.com/crash31/craft3-starter project-name`
- Go into the new project folder and remove old git info `cd project-name && rm -rf .git`
- Initialize a fresh git repo on project `git init`
- Install backend dependencies `composer install`
- Install frontend dependencies `npm install` or `yarn install`

# Setup notes
- Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
- Configure `MIX_PROXY_URL` to your development url
- Clone repository and run `./craft setup`. If you ge error run `chmod +x ./craft`
- When setup has completed, log in, go to setting -> plugins and install the Mix plugin. Go to Mix settings and change the public path setting to `public`. 
- Everything in the root of the `templates` folder should start with an underscore, including folders. This prevents craft rendering files if a url matches the filename. 

# External Services
Before starting the project it is good to find out if we are hosting the website or not, this has impact on if we configure the following services. 
- SMTP email sending through Mandrill
- Asset storage on DigitalOcean spaces/cdn. 

If we are not hosting, do not configure either of the above services.

# General Best Practices
- If using external fonts, try to import only the fonts and weights you need. 
- If you feel like using font awesome, don't. It is heavy! Consider just extracting the icons you need or using something like [Fontello](https://github.com/fontello/fontello).

# .env file
Everything from machine specific configurations to sensitive details should live in the config file, including:
- SMTP Information
- Mix Proxy URL
- etc.

In a project repository, if you add to the config file, be sure to update the .env.example file as well. 

# Standard Plugins
These are the Craft CMS Plugins that we use on every project:

*Free:*
- [Redactor](https://imperavi.com/redactor/)
- [Mix](https://github.com/mister-bk/craft-plugin-mix/blob/master/README.md)
- [Typed Link Field](https://plugins.craftcms.com/typedlinkfield)

# Tailwind.config.js
Your tailwind config file should be `in addition to` and not `replicating` tailwind's defaults. Your goal should be for any developer entering your project to be able to rely on tailwind's official doc, utilize any of the default classes, and know what additional classes are available by skimming your config file.

## Tools for an optimal frontend

[Type-Scale](https://type-scale.com/) is a great tool for laying out the scale of your typography.

[Color Shades Generator](https://javisperez.github.io/tailwindcolorshades/#/) will layout a gradient of colors legible for Tailwind's config file.

# Vue 3
[Documentation](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html)

Vue (pronounced /vjuÀê/, like view) is a progressive framework for building user interfaces. Unlike other monolithic frameworks, Vue is designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable. The core library is focused on the view layer only, and is easy to pick up and integrate with other libraries or existing projects. On the other hand, Vue is also perfectly capable of powering sophisticated Single-Page Applications when used in combination with [modern tooling](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/single-file-component.html) and [supporting libraries](https://github.com/vuejs/awesome-vue#components--libraries)

# Buddy config (buddy.crash31.com)
**Sync Files Action**

Set ignore paths based on project requirements. A good default:
```
/.git/
.env
/vendor/
/web/.htaccess
/web/content/
/storage/
/node_modules/
```
**SSH Commands**
```
composer install
php craft migrate/all
php craft project-config/apply
yarn install
yarn run prod
ln -s web public
```
